When deciding which to use, consider the information that is most important to your user and what makes the most sense for your use case. For example, if a user knows they have 123 farm animals and theyâ€™re interested in knowing how many of those animals are cows, it probably makes more sense to use an integer value. If that same user is interested in knowing how much storage space they have left in their grain silo, a percentage might be better.`}
